# Calendar_App
A personal challenge to code a flutter calendar app (Android and IOS)

## Demo
The goal is to let the user know when and where they last invited a guest and what set they served that day.

## Versions Historic

- V0.3: First working version. Saves data locally on the phone. Benefit: quick to query data. Drawback: Data could be lost if a phone breaks down. 
- V1.0 (current version): Link with a backend and a MYSQL database hosted on Railway. Benefit: No data loss in case of phone breaking. Drawback: Data querying is slower, and the solution is expensive. 
- V1.1: Link a FireBase process to log in.
- V1.2: Link with an AWS container to lower the server hosting price.
